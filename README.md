# Recipes

## Overview
I've wanted to try out NextJS on a side project for a while, as well as wanting to document some of my favourite recipes somewhere, so I've combined the two!

- Uses create-next-app
- No CSS/FE framework, just my terrible design!
- Focus on performance, Core Web Vitals

## Next Steps
Currently there is just a single hard-coded recipe. It would be interesting to see how the API/dynamic routes works but this is a good starting point. Future ideas includes:
- Improve UI / Homepage
- Dynamically created recipes (others can submit recipes)
- Ability to add notes to a recipe page
- Pictures! (gotta keep it performant)
